	- I've decided that I've learned enough about Bootstrap to begin work on my project. Of course, there will still be plenty of learning along the way.
	- Going over the project requirements and taking note of what order I should work in, what tools I will use, etc.
	- Looking at Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, and iPhone email apps to gather visual information about good Email app layouts.

	- Very productive night! Watched the Figma tutorial video and got a LOT of hands on experience creating the mobile size mockup for my email project.
	- Mobile design looks really great! Now I just need to adapt it to tablet and desktop sizes and I'm ready to begin coding.

	- Stayed up late on a Saturday finishing my Figma prototypes for desktop and tablet. One thing I've learned is that designing for a small screen first makes
		it wayyyy easier to scale up than vice versa. I'm happy with the look and will get started on the code tomorrow.

	- Getting the basic mobile layout working. The approximate locations of everything are good, but I'm still having trouble with the intracacies and tweaks behind bootsrap.
